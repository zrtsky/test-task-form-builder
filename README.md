## Description

Here i used default starter template of Vite with React and Typescript. I have created a form builder which can be used to create forms with different types of fields. Like described before in the tech regiments I don't use any form libraries like Formik or React-hook-form. I have created a custom hook to handle the form state and validation. I have used React-query to handle the form submission and error handling. I have used Tailwind CSS for styling and NextUi for the UI components. I have used Framer Motion for animations. I have used Date-fns for date formatting.
